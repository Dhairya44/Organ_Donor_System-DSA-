# Organ_Donor_System-DSA-

A name is added to the national transplant waiting list every 9 minutes. On average, 17
people die every day from the lack of available organs for transplant. Our project aims
to match organ donors to recipients who need transplants.
Donors and Recipients are stored in separate 2D arrays. Each spot in the array
contains the pointer to the head of the linked list of individuals based on different
requirements. We will implement a searching algorithm on a graph that includes the
locations of donors and recipients and will find the shortest possible path. Each patient
has blood type, Required Blood Type, Location, etc. Donors also have the same
qualities. The user can add and remove a donor or recipient, view and count the donors
and patients waiting for a match. This program will find the best possible organ and
blood type match under given constraints. If a match is found on adding a patient or a
donor, that donor-recipient pair will be added to a queue. In the case of multiple
partners, the program will provide the closest possible location of the donor to increase
the chance of survival.
